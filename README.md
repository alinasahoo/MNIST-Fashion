# MNIST Fashion

This is a basic classofication project using TensorFlow and Keras. It trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts.

Fashion MNIST is intended as a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST datasetâ€”often used as the "Hello, World" of machine learning programs for computer vision. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0, 1, 2, etc.) in a format identical to that of the articles of clothing.
